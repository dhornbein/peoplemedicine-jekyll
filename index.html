            <p>What if the work we’re doing to build a more equitable and life-sustaining world were also regenerative and healing for us, the people doing it?</p>
            <p>Do you sense tectonic weaknesses in the social change-making systems we’re investing our life energies in? Do you wonder if deep down, we’re collectively really getting anywhere? </p>
            <p>We believe that if we turn towards these tectonic rumblings now, we’ll be better able to shape-shift our organizations to meet the wickedly complex challenges our world is facing. </p>
            <p>We think that the organizational practices we need the most in this moment of tumultuous change are those that strengthen trust and belonging - but that these practices only flourish when people really feel held by solid patterns of high-functioning communication, decision-making and accountability in their organization. </p>
            <p>Let us help you make your teams more resilient and your work more regenerative for you, your organization and the people you serve.</p>

            <p>We experience designers who specialize in integrating two key dimensions of organizational effectiveness: trust and structure. If your organization has weak trust bonds, either internally or externally, the effectiveness of your most tried and true business structures will be constantly draining away. Similarly, if your organizational practices for decision making, communication and accountability are shaky, it’s hard for people to trust themselves or each other or to bring their most powerful, whole selves to their work.</p>
            <p>It’s when these two dimensions are holistically woven together, so that high trust levels and solid structures flow into and strengthen one another, that teams unlock higher levels of well-being, collective intelligence, effectiveness and impact.</p>
            <p>We design regenerative organizational patterns for social change-makers at all levels by integrating the social-emotional dimensions of trust and belonging with the functionality of good business structures. We help groups of any size step into deep organizational resilience for the complex and increasingly chaotic future rising to meet us. </p>
