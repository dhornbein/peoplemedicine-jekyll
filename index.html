            <p>We are experienced social designers who integrate trust and structure for changemakers. If your organization has weak trust bonds, either internally or externally, the effectiveness of your most tried and true business structures will be constantly draining away. Similarly, if your organizational practices for decision making, communication and accountability are shaky, it’s hard for people to trust themselves or each other or to bring their most powerful, whole selves to their work.</p>
            <p>It’s when these two dimensions are holistically woven together, so that high trust levels and solid business structures flow into and strengthen one another, that teams unlock higher levels of well-being, collective intelligence, effectiveness and impact.</p>
            <p>We design regenerative organizational patterns for social change-makers at all levels by integrating the social-emotional dimensions of trust and belonging with the functionality of good business structures. We help groups of any size step into deep organizational resilience for the complex and increasingly chaotic future rising to meet us.</p>
            <p>Let us help you make your teams more resilient and your work more regenerative for you, your organization and the people you serve.</p>
