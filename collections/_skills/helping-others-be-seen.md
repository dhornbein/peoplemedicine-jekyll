Many highly social species like ants, elephants, whales, and chimpanzees value the gifts and talents of specific individuals in their groups. Animal elders are not just the oldest 

Make a regular practice of appreciating the gifts that others bring to the everyday table of our interactions: normalize this practice so it becomes second nature in the group culture, like taking sips of water. Weave a running thread of specific appreciations through ordinary meetings, conversations, and gatherings: get people in the habit of collectively witnessing the bigger Selves that live in each one of us.
