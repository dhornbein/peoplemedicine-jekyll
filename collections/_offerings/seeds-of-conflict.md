Most groups look for processes to handle conflict only after it erupts. But we need to be able to work skillfully with the seeds of conflict well before it arises, so that when it does, we are warmed up and ready to greet it as a familiar friend here to teach us valuable lessons. 

This session helps teams and individuals develop skills for welcoming and working with the interpersonal tensions and knots that create the kindling for full-blown conflicts. Weâ€™ll show you how to successfully plant seeds of trust in your personal and professional relationships, by normalizing the occurrence of trust knots and tensions and unlocking their regenerative power to deepen relationships.
