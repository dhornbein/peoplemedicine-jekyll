## Consensus
Produces a strong buy-in and team unity, but can take a long time. Best used for decisions of high significance or high risk. Very effective for increasing shared understanding and creating strong bonds within a team.

## Consent
Priorities speed over agreement, which can encourage action & experimentation, but can also reduce quality. If you’re in a consensus-oriented group wanting to move faster, or a hierarchical group looking for more inclusion & power-sharing, the consent process can be an excellent option. Best for less significant or less risky decisions.

## Advice
Maximizes autonomy, while still making use of collective intelligence. Works best if there is a strong alignment around purpose, and you have proactive measures to support healthy disagreement. Particularly suited to decisions with unpredictable outcomes, or where special expertise is required.

## Mandate
When teams mature and people understand each other’s strengths, the majority of decisions can be delegated to individuals or subteams with a mandate. Best operated with transparency, so you can see what is being decided, even if you’re not consulted.
