Norms are the rules of play for any shared experience. Be it standing in line for coffee, playing football, or dropping bombs via remote-controlled drones there are rules. Some rules are written down but so many more are implicit.

Consider a conversation between three friends. Imagine that they are playing a game called "conversation". They all know the rules. How long you pause before speaking, how to make a little noise when you want someone to pass you the attention.

Sometimes people can play the game of conversation that leaves some voices out.

By talking about the rules of play we expect from each other we can begin to thoughtfully craft our games.
