title: Warm Data Flows
description: >-
  Warm Data is flowing around us at all times. It's the unacknowledged Oceanic Soup of non-measureable information that human beings are constantly bathed in/shaped by/picking up on and responding to at all times, coming from the multiple overlapping contexts in which we exist: food, relationships, material economy, health, embodiment, power, politics, cultural norms, the more-than-human world, language, the built environment...Warm Data can't be measured without taking it out of its reciprocal interrelated context-dependency. Warm Data is what really drives social and behavior change, only we don't realize it - but we can change that
principle: Sharing more context can open rich flows of vital, non-measureable information that enliven and recharge relationships, collaborations and teams.
