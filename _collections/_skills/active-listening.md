Before responding to what someone has said, let them know you’re really listening and signal positive intent by reflecting back to them what you heard them saying, sticking closely to their own words ("What I hear you saying is…"). 

In your reflection, try to avoid JIFing:

* **Judging** - saying anything that passes
  judgment on what is being said, even if
  it’s positive! Especially if it is negative
* **Interpreting** - making extra assumptions
  about what the speaker meant
* **Fixing** - anything that attempts to
  address or solve what comes up
