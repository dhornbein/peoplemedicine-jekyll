> Conflict is the spirit of the relationship asking itself to deepen. <br>

The key to tapping into the relationship-deepening power of conflict is to break down the complexity of conflict situations into manageable chunks. We offer this to teams and individuals who have previously worked with us to learn the Seed practices (for sowing trust and harvesting conflicts early, when they are still ‘baby-sized’). We guide participants through a sequence of 3 facilitated processes to support them in feeling that their pain has been witnessed and their values have been honored: 

- **Green Room**: participants take turns getting their Story off their chest while being heard by the other party, inside a strongly protective container that protects both story-teller and listener from unfairness, harshness and blame. 
- **Observatory**: After hearing each other’s stories, participants weave their realities together guided by respect for each other’s values and desire to stay in relationship.
- **Sacred Repair**: participants make trust-sized, actionable Medicine Requests for the next time they encounter the “footprint” of this conflict.
