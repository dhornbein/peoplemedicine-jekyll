Are you leading a team, putting together a group, or running an organization? Are things falling through the cracks? Deadlines being missed? Conflict and confusion arising? It might seem like what’s needed is a complicated project management system or expensive software solution, but the real problem is often more straightforward: your group has unspoken, unclear or confusing group settings which not everyone has consented to, and what you really need is a simple, targeted set of Wise Agreements to get things moving smoothly again.

In this session, you’ll get a dashboard to help you understand where wise agreements can most effectively work to prevent friction and wasted energy. You’ll also get a set of regenerative Wise Patterns to bring your new agreements to life, as well as the coaching to make these patterns attainable for your team:

- Easeful and inclusive decision-making
- Firmly-rooted roles and responsibilities
- Rhythmic meeting architecture that builds long-term organizational resilience

Whether you’re a bunch of friends planning this years’ group camping reunion, a dedicated team of social changemakers or a mid-to-large organization working to shift the system, these patterns and tools can be applied wherever people are collaborating for the greater good.
