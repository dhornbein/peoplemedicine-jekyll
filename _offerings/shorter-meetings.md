If team meetings were a mood in your organization, would it be tedious and burdensome? Energizing and uplifting? The key to shorter, more effective meetings lies in best practices that effectively channel your team’s productive energy - coupled with just the right amount of psychological safety and trust to keep things humming. 

We think we hold meetings, when the reality is that meetings hold us - they hold us captive inside inefficient rules of play that block group flow and deplete the team’s energetic field while concealing the real power structures in the room. But we don’t need to overhaul meeting culture from top to bottom - we just need to hit key acupuncture points that bring in more psychological safety and autonomy for participants while improving meeting flow and efficiency.
