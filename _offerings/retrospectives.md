Is your team **wasting valuable learning** because you aren’t pausing to optimize your own process? We believe that a simple pattern of Retrospective Practices can have a very big impact on your team’s ability to spot **patterns** that work well and **details** that need improvement. Within the protective structure of a good Retrospective, teams can apply their collective intelligence to working better together by **integrating lessons, applying self-regulation, and accepting feedback**. We help you build these patterns into your daily, weekly, monthly, and project **rhythms**.
