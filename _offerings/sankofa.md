We urgently need a way to tap into the collective power of key life lessons we never took the time to unpack, and we need a way to do this in a context of warmth, ease, trust, and psychological safety. Sankofa Circles are a facilitated group process modelled on the [Ghanian concept of “going backwards to go forward:”](https://www.berea.edu/cgwc/the-power-of-sankofa/) in this 2-hour session, we support and guide participants in co-creating a deeply regenerative experience of mutual learning focused on critical areas where social changemakers frequently experience frustration and failure, such as: 

- **Trust**: how does trust show up in your organization(s)? What has helped build trust? What has eroded trust?
- **Power**: how has power shown up in our lives, was it hidden? When it showed itself, how was it wielded? Were you or others able to talk about it? 
- **Money**: what is our relationship with money? What emotions and stories are bound up with it? How could our relationship to money be better?
- **Work**: What is our relationship to work? When has work felt generative? What has made it feel extractive? What do we need for our work to feel balanced and good?
